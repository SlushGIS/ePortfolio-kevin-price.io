						Access to computers and a broadband Internet
						subscription has become increasingly important to
						Americans in carrying out their day-to-day lives.<sup>1</sup> This
						technology is used for a variety of activities including
						accessing health information, online banking,
						choosing a place to live, applying for jobs, looking
						up government services, and taking classes. Access
						to broadband Internet also has positive effects on
						individual empowerment, economic growth, and community
						development.<sup>2</sup>
					</p>
					<p>
						Data about computer use have been collected periodically
						in the Current Population Survey (CPS) since
						1984 and data about Internet use have been collected
						in the CPS since 1997. The CPS data provide nationaland
						state-level estimates. The American Community
						Survey (ACS) began collecting these data in 2013
						and provides yearly estimates for geographies with
						populations of 65,000 people or more. This report
						uses data from the CPS to provide historical context
						and data from the ACS to highlight characteristics that
						are more current.

						<sup>1</sup> A “broadband” Internet subscription refers to having at least one
						type of Internet subscription other than a dial-up subscription alone.
						In the American Community Survey, it specifically refers to those who
						said “Yes” to one or more of the following types of subscriptions:
						DSL, cable, fiber optic, mobile broadband, satellite, or fixed wireless.

					<h3 class="blueHeading">Key Differences Between the American Community Survey and the Current Population Survey</h3>
					<p>
						The Current Population Survey (CPS) has been collecting data about
						computer use since 1984 and Internet use since 1997. In 2013, the
						American Community Survey (ACS) also began collecting data on
						these topics as mandated by the 2008 Broadband Data Improvement
						Act. Strengths of the CPS data include the greater detail available
						through its longer questionnaire and its longer time series, whereas
						the ACS, with its larger sample size, provides estimates at more
						detailed levels of geography. Estimates of computer and Internet
						use vary between these surveys due to differences in weighting
						procedures, data collection methods, and question wording. Federal
						agencies use these statistics to measure and monitor the nationwide
						development of broadband networks and to allocate resources
						intended to increase access to broadband technologies, particularly
						among groups with traditionally low levels of access. State and
						local governments can use these statistics for similar purposes.
						Understanding how people in specific cities and towns use computers
						and the Internet will help businesses and nonprofits better serve
						their communities as well.

						Table 1 displays computer and

					<p>
						lagged behind households with
						younger householders on both

						small, with percentages ranging
						between 81 percent for households
						with householders aged 15 to
						34, and 85 percent for the 35- to
						44-year-old group. However, only
						65 percent of households headed
						by a person aged 65 and older
						owned or used a desktop or laptop.
						Handheld computer ownership or
						use showed even more variation by
						age of householder. Ninety percent
						of households with householders
						aged 15 to 34 had a handheld computer,
						compared with 89 percent
						where the householder was aged
						35 to 44, 78 percent where the
						householder was aged 45 to 64,

				<td style="width:33.33%">

						was 65 years and older.
						Similar to desktop or laptop ownership
						or use, there were narrow
						differences in broadband Internet
						subscription among the three
						younger age groups, with percentages
						ranging from 80 percent for
						the 45- to 64-year-old group to 84
						percent for the 35- to 44-year-old
						group, compared with only 62
						percent of households headed by a
						person aged 65 and older.
					</p>
					<p>
						Computer and Internet use also
						varied according to race and
						Hispanic origin of the householder.
						Households with an Asian householder
						were most likely to own or
						use a desktop or laptop, own or
						use a handheld device, and have a
						broadband Internet subscription.

						computer or smartphone, and a
						broadband Internet subscription.
						Households where the householder
						was less than 65 years old were
						more likely to be highly connected
						compared with households headed
						by people 65 years and older. In
						fact, among households with a
						householder aged 65 and older, 39
						percent lacked either a computer
						or a subscription to the Internet.
						Households with higher household
						income were also more likely to
						be highly connected. Of households
						with a household income of

						broadband, a desktop or laptop,
